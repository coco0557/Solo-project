i will be learning as i go on throughout this project, so there will be lota of updates and many errors which i will see later.
I will be using vsCode for the frontend design work and using Netbeans23 for backend.
This is just so it will be easier for me to keep the two seperate for a while before i decide on the design.

The proccess for getting the stock list was to speak to the owner of the restaurant snd tell him about the idea 
of digitlising the stock system so it can be accessed from anywhere at all times. 
This makes it more effiecient for the owner/kitchen staff as they will not be required to be in the 
restaurant to see the stock levels as they would be able to seee current stock levels from their home.
