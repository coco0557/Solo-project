I’m building this project while learning, so there will be regular updates and improvements as I progress. 
I expect there will be some errors and trial and error early on, but this is part of my learning process.

I’m using VS Code for the frontend design and NetBeans 25 for the backend Java development.
Keeping these separate helps me stay organised while I focus on functionality first and decide on the design later.

The initial step was to speak directly with the owner of the restaurant where I work, and explain the idea of digitising the stock system. 
The goal is to make the system accessible from anywhere
so that the owner and kitchen staff can check stock levels remotely, without needing to be physically at the restaurant.

There are currently around 99 items to be managed in the system, which I’m organising into different categories and Java classes
(e.g Meat & Seafood, Vegetables, Prepared Items). These will help structure the code in a maintainable way as the project grows.
here are the classes i have decided to group the items (objects) into:

🥩 Meat & Seafood  
Chicken breast 
Cooked chicken 
Spare rib meat
Pork neck 
Duck

King prawn

i have now put all the classes into code.
the next step for me now is to create a StockManagement system

Now that they are grouped into classes i have to establish how the classes relate to eachother (i.e. inheritance, composition etc)

i will be using composition

30/07/25
i will be creating an Inventory management file as this will allow me to 
display items from all classes and will become the centra place for 
managing stock in the future.
i have created and Inventory manager, StockCategory and Item.java 
here are what all of them do and how they relate to OOP

Encapsulation ('Item' hides its data using private fields)

Inheritance ('spiceAndSeasonings'(and all categories) inherits from 'StockCategory')

Polymorphism (treating 'spiceAndSeasonings' as a 'StockCategory')

Composition ('InventoryManager' is composed of 'StockCategory' objects)
