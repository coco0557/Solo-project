FreshCount started as a Java console application that used Scanner to collect input and print outputs to the terminal.
The goal now is to transform it into a full-stack web application with:

A Java backend (Servlet-based)

A dynamic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend

AJAX/Fetch API calls to exchange JSON data between the frontend and backend

Database persistence (SQLite/MySQL) in later phases
