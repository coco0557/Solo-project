FreshCount started as a Java console application that used Scanner to collect input and print outputs to the terminal.
The goal now is to transform it into a full-stack web application with:

A Java backend (Servlet-based)

A dynamic HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend

AJAX/Fetch API calls to exchange JSON data between the frontend and backend

Database persistence (SQLite/MySQL) in later phases

Why Remove the Scanner for Frontend Input
Overview
As FreshCount evolves from a console-based application to a full web-based stock management system, 
removing the Java Scanner in favor of frontend input is a crucial architectural decision that aligns 
with modern development practices and our restaurant's real-world needs.
Key Benefits
1. Separation of Concerns

Backend (Java): Handles business logic, data processing, and storage
Frontend (HTML/JS/CSS): Manages user interface and user experience
This creates cleaner, more maintainable code where each layer has a specific responsibility

2. Better User Experience

Scanner: Command-line interface is text-based and limited
Web Frontend: Rich, interactive UI with buttons, forms, dropdowns, and visual feedback
Users can see stock levels in tables, get visual warnings for low stock, and use intuitive navigation

3. Remote Access (Key for Our Use Case!)
Since the restaurant owner wants to check stock remotely, a web interface is essential:

Scanner: Only works locally on the machine running the Java program
Web Frontend: Accessible from any device with internet access (phone, tablet, home computer)

4. Multi-User Support

Scanner: Single user at a time
Web Frontend: Multiple staff members can access simultaneously

5. Data Visualization

Scanner: Text-only output
Web Frontend: Charts, color-coded stock levels, search/filter capabilities

Implementation Impact
This change transforms FreshCount from a local development tool into a practical, production-ready system that meets the actual needs of our restaurant environment - enabling remote monitoring and multi-user access as originally requested by the owner.
